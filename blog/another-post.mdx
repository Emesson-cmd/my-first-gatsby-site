# Understanding TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It's an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript helps developers catch and prevent common errors at compile-time, making code more robust and maintainable.

## Benefits of TypeScript

TypeScript offers several advantages, including:

- **Static Typing:** TypeScript enforces type checking at compile-time, reducing runtime errors.

- **IDE Support:** Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code provide excellent TypeScript support, offering features like autocompletion and refactoring.

- **Enhanced Code Quality:** Type annotations make code more self-documenting and easier to understand.

- **ES6+ Compatibility:** TypeScript supports the latest ECMAScript features, ensuring you can use modern JavaScript alongside static typing.

- **Community and Ecosystem:** TypeScript has a growing community, and many popular libraries and frameworks have TypeScript support.

## Getting Started with TypeScript

To get started with TypeScript, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Install TypeScript globally using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
